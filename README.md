# Password-Generator


## Description
This was a homework assignment to use Javascript to create a Random Password Generator.<br />
I ended up having to go in and add to the css to get the password to stay in the box.


## Usage
You click the generate button then go through a few prompts and you get you a new password to use<br />
that you can copy and paste.
